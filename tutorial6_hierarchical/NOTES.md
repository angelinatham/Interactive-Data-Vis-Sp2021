- What did you have trouble solving?
I used Afsana's code to see if I could just get it to show up on the live view. It worked, but I didn't like how it's all scattered. I picked at it to see how to group them into the larger pack circles. I couldn't figure it out? I used the // notes in the code to see what each thing does, but I couldn't figure out where to modify the code. I also used some of Laura's to see how she got it into the neat circles. Still didn't work. Confusing.
