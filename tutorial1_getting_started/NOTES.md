this was a bit confusing on pc so i bought a mac, it's coming tomorrow lol
it was confusing to switch from git bash to this. i wasn't sure what i was actually doing. it also took a while for me to find the dropbox recording of class. 
i think your tutorial was a lot more helpful than the github text instructions.
