## NOTES

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.
- What did you have trouble solving?

Couldn't figure out how to format the X Axis properly. I changed it to ordinal, but it won't show all the names of the donuts :(
I also tried making the scatter plot points into the doughnut emoji üç© but couldn't figure out how to make the emoji extension work lol

- What went easier than expected?

The drop down list was easy

- What, if anything, is currently blocking you?

I'm taking the CS Algorithms class for fun (but it's not fun), and it's too late to switch out so I'm taking the W. Before deciding this, it was eating up alllllll my time. So between classes like Interactive Data and work, it was hard to juggle completing assignments before 5AM ! But, I'll just withdraw from algorithms so now I'll have time to do assignments earlier and I can ask for help before submitting !!!

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
