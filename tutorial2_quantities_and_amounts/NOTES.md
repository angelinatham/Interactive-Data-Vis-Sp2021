- What did you have trouble solving?

I bought a new Mac Pro cause I thought it'd be easier to follow along for class tutorials, like simultaneously. But, turns out it caused a whole lot of new problems for VSCode. Like, it made my Mac a new host in terminal? So, there would be a fatal error if I tried looking at what repository I was using. 

ALSO, I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET 2 CHARTS ON THE SITE. I could get one vertical, and one horizontal but not at the same time... So, I looked at classmates' work and tried to see what worked and what didn't. BUT WHEN I PUT THEIRS into mine, it just didn't work (only my title would show up in live view, no bars, or it would be one black square). So, I tried using the class code. That worked, but when I flipped things around to make them horizontal, I kept getting weird errors about a messy tree or something like that. SO, I tried building off the demo code. That didn't work though (nothing in the live view)! I installed an extension that creates charts automatically, but I figured that was cheating? AT THIS POINT I created a ton of graphs, but I don't know if there's a way to restore your deleted work. Like, the formatting of the axes are always the same, but since I copied people's color schemes, it threw off the whole thing when I tried to delete it. I ended up using some of the demo, and some of the in class tutorial code, and someone else's formatting for the on screen text. I TRIED REDOING IT SO THAT I could customize it, but any time I touched it, the whole chart would disappear. :( For example, I tried editing the original CSV to capitalize the activities texts, but it would get rid of the whole chart. So, I tried

I want to redo this this week so it's more of how I wanted it to look.

- What went easier than expected?

Thankfully, the tutorials are really streamlined. It's easy to skip through to figure out where I went wrong if I missed a step by just scrolling through the video. 

Changing colors in CSS is fun.

- What, if anything, is currently blocking you?

I need to figure out how to set up my repository on my new laptop! Can I only use one laptop per repository? I don't get it. I tried rebooting it from tutorial 1, but that didn't work. Maybe I have to fork in a new repository??

How do I edit the code so that I don't ruin the whole live view?

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
