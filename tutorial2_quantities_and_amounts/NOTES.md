## NOTES

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.
- What did you have trouble solving?

I bought a new Mac Pro cause I thought it'd be easier to follow along for class tutorials, like simultaneously. But, turns out it caused a whole lot of new problems for VSCode. Like, it made my Mac a new host in terminal? So, there would be a fatal error if I tried looking at what repository I was using. 

ALSO, I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET 2 CHARTS ON THE SITE. I could get one vertical, and one horizontal but not at the same time...

- What went easier than expected?

Thankfully, the tutorials are really streamlined. It's easy to skip through to figure out where I went wrong if I missed a step by just scrolling through the video. 

Changing colors in CSS is fun.

- What, if anything, is currently blocking you?

I need to figure out how to set up my repository on my new laptop! Can I only use one laptop per repository? I don't get it. I tried rebooting it from tutorial 1, but that didn't work. Maybe I have to fork in a new repository??

How do I edit the code so that I don't ruin the whole live view?

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
